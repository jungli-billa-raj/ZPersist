I'm building a :
** Persistent Data Structure with explicit invariants ** 

1️⃣ What is a “binary layout table” (with examples)
A binary layout table is just you answering:
“At byte X, what lives there, how big is it, and what does it mean?”

7️⃣ The key takeaway (this should settle your confusion)
A file format is not “about data types”.
It is about layout + invariants + access patterns.
Once you grasp that, the rest becomes engineering, not mystery.
